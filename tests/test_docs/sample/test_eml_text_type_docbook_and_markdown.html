<p>The 1-meter land cover map was generated primarily using the 2015 NAIP imagery. It has eight land cover classes and achieved an
overall accuracy of 94%. This detailed land cover map was created in the eCognition software using the object-based classification
approach. The first step was NAIP image segmentation, where pixels with similar spectral and spatial characteristics were grouped
into parcel sized or finer objects. Next, hierarchical rule-based expert systems were developed to classify the objects into
specific land cover classes based on their spectral, morphological, and contextual attributes.<br />
Various auxiliary GIS data were utilized to improve classification accuracy. They include the 2015 cadastral parcel data, the 2014
USGS Lidar data (1-meter), the 2014 Microsoft/OpenStreetMap Building Footprint data, the 2015 Street TIGER/Line, and the previous
NAIP-based land cover map for the year of 2010. Specifically, building footprints and Lidar data significantly improved the
boundary detection of above-ground objects. Compared to the 2010 NAIP-based land cover map, buildings and tree canopy shapes were
classified more accurately. Finally, post-classification manual editing was applied to minimize classification errors.</p>

<li>&amp;: Lidar data only covered 21% of the study area. Within the Lidar data extent, tree and grass achieved higher accuracy
&gt;95%. Beyond Lidar coverage, the tree versus grass classification was less accurate due to the lack of surface height
information. As a result, tree and grass achieved accuracies of 90% - 92% over the entire study area.</li>

<h2 id="laboratory-procedure">Laboratory Procedure</h2>
<p>Sediment samples were divided in half to run for chlorophyll and AFDM. Rock samples were scrubbed in a glass dish using a
toothbrush. Excess water in each field sample container was filtered into folded 110 mm GF/A filt<br />
ers into a 200ml beaker. Algae from scrubbed rocks were also poured through GF/A filters. Algae remaining on dish and rocks were
washed into filters using as little DI water as possible. Filters were cut in half for analysis of chlorophyll a and AFDM. Se<br
/>
diment along with half of the respective filters was placed together into a 200 mL beaker. Filters from rocks were also placed in
200 mL beakers. 20 mL of reagent grade methanol was added to beakers. Beakers were placed in water bath and allowed to boil<br />
at 80-85 degrees C for 2-4 minutes. Next, extract from each sample was poured into separate 100 ml beakers. Methanol addition and
boiling was repeated until no green pigment was visible on sediment, filter, or in extract. After final extraction, the tota<br />
l volume of extract collected for each sample was filtered through a GF/F filter (a GF/A was used for samples collected in
2010-2013). Filtered extract was poured into a graduated cylinder. The volume of extract was increased to the nearest 20 ml line
by<br />
adding methanol. Volume was recorded and samples covered with parafilm to minimize evaporation. Absorbance values of extracts were
measured at 750, 666, and 480 nm before and after acidification (see table below) using a Beckman DUÂ® 530 Spectrophotomete<br />

<p>Chlorophyll calculations are made as follows:</p>
<p><em>Chl a (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) = 219. 2(D666-D666a) * v / A</em></p>
<p>where 219.2 is the absorption coefficient for chlorophyll a in methanol times the conversion from ug/cm<sup>2</sup> to
mg/m<sup>2</sup>; v is extraction volume in mL; A is area of the sampled sub<br />
strate, 12.315 cm<sup>2</sup>, half the area of collected core; D666 is absorbance at 666 minus absorbance at 750 before
acidification, and D666a is absorbance at 666 minus absorbance at 750 after acidification.</p></div><div><div class="section"><div
